I have several notable achievements in my career. My proudest achievement is I developed the .net C# based Excel Plugin, which is a core feature for the product - Locus Platform. What made it proudest for me was that I started this project from scratch and wrote it all by my own. As the owner of this product, I designed the user-friendly UI, and added multi-threads which have greatly improved the speed. This core feature help customers handle the massive data process efficiently that save at least 80% of time comparing the old method. After releasing the Excel Plugin, I received numerous accolades from both internal teams and our customers.
